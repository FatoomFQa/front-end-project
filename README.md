### Describe how some of your favorite functions work
- This function worked after clicking by the user
  first we have one id for all pictures  in first time has a class pic1
  if the user click 1 (#num) that mean it's true

```js
 $('#num1').click (function()
{
   if ($('#img').hasClass("pic1"))
   {
 
    right.play();
    $('.star').show();
    $('.star').hide('slow');
    $("#img").addClass("pic2");
    $('#img').removeClass("pic1");
   }
  else 
   {console.log('loser');
wrong.play();
$('.dislike').show();
$('.dislike').hide('slow');
